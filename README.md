The best UNSW timetabling program in existance!

## The purpose
The goal of this project is to provide UNSW students, and particularly those involved in Campus Bible Study, a tool to help them to create their timetable in a way which best suits them, and helps them to be able to attend Campus Bible Study events.

We aim to generate a reasonably good timetable for users, however because everyone has their own timetabling preferences, we simply try to do a "good enough" job of this. Users are then able to easily customise their timetable by dragging their classes around. Since people seem to enjoy the feeling of improving their timetable in this way, we don't expect to add more options to customise the generation process.

## Ideas to implement

* Close button in all modals
* Week based clash detection
* Multiple times allowed for custom classes
