# CrossAngles
... soon to be the best UNSW timetabling program in existance!

## Ideas to implement

  * Favicon
  * Better visual feedback for timetable clashes
  * Hide unnecessary rows of timetable
  * Custom class/commitment support
  * Fullscreen timetable view?
  * Day of week preferences? (I'm thinking they can do that manually by rearranging their timetable)
  * Analytics?
