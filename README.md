# CrossAngles

> The easiest way to plan your UNSW timetable for next semester

### Considerations for later:
* Manhattan distance instead of Pythagorean for class snapping?
* Week-intelligent clash detection
* Make auto-update more respectful
* Fix dragged sessions showing above navbar/footer
* Mark stream constraints
* Clash display
* Save as image
* Multi-threading for search
* Update session positions/widths on timetable resize
* Update sidebar menu
